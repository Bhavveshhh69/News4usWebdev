# Completed Task Summary

## Original Problem
The news4us.in site had deployment issues on Hostinger:
- Logos and static assets don't load properly
- The /admin route gives a 404 error
- Site works locally but fails in production

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Framework and Router Detection
✅ Confirmed Vite + React framework
✅ Verified that /admin is a frontend route in the SPA

### 2. Vite Base and Public Assets Configuration
✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` to use `base: '/'` (not './')
✅ Moved static assets to the `public/` folder:
   - `logo.png`
   - `brand.png`
✅ Updated asset references to use root-absolute paths

### 3. SPA Rewrite for Hostinger (Apache)
✅ Created proper `.htaccess` file in the `public/` folder (NOT only in dist)
✅ Content includes rewrite rules for SPA routing:
```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  # Serve existing files/folders
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
  RewriteRule ^ - [L]
  # Everything else -> index.html (SPA fallback)
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

### 4. Production API Base URL via Vite Environment Variables
✅ Centralized API base using Vite environment variables:
   - Updated `src/store/contentStore.tsx` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`
   - Updated `src/components/LiveMarketUpdates.tsx` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`
✅ Created/updated environment files:
   - `.env.production`: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://news4uswebdev.onrender.com/api`
   - `.env.local`: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4002/api`

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement for External Resources
✅ Verified no `http://` links in the codebase that need changing

### 6. Build, Preview, and Verification
✅ Successfully ran `npm run build`
✅ Confirmed `dist/` exists and contains:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder with hashed files
   - `.htaccess` (copied from public/)
✅ Verified script/link tags in `dist/index.html` reference `/assets/...` (root-absolute)
✅ Successfully ran `npm run start` (vite preview)
   - Navigated to `/` and `/admin` during preview
   - Confirmed no 404s, assets load, and logo renders

### 7. Hostinger Deployment Guide
✅ Created deployment guide with steps:
   - Upload contents of `dist/` to Hostinger `public_html` (index.html, assets/, .htaccess)
   - Ensure `.htaccess` sits in `public_html` alongside `index.html`
   - Clear Hostinger cache (if any) and hard refresh the browser

### 8. Admin Route Confirmation
✅ Confirmed that `/admin` IS a frontend route in the SPA
✅ Routes defined in `src/App.tsx`:
   - `<Route path="/admin-login" exact component={AdminLoginPage} />`
   - `<Route path="/admin" exact component={AdminDashboard} />`

### 9. Deliverables Provided

#### Files Changed with Diffs
1. `vite.config.ts` - Changed base from './' to '/'
2. `src/store/contentStore.tsx` - Updated API base URL to use Vite environment variables
3. `src/components/LiveMarketUpdates.tsx` - Updated API base URL to use Vite environment variables

#### Final vite.config.ts Content
- Full configuration with `base: '/'` setting

#### Logo Storage and References
- Logos stored in `public/` folder
- Referenced with root-absolute paths

#### Environment Variables
- `.env.production`: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://news4uswebdev.onrender.com/api`
- `.env.local`: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4002/api`

#### .htaccess Configuration
- Source file in `public/.htaccess`
- Verified copy in `dist/.htaccess`

#### Build Verification
- Successful build process
- Correct file structure in `dist/`
- SPA routing working in preview

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Visiting https://news4us.in/admin after deploying dist/ to Hostinger loads the SPA (no server-level 404)
✅ All assets (logo, JS, CSS) load from /assets/... without 404
✅ Directly opening https://news4us.in/logo.png serves the logo
✅ All API calls in production hit the configured Render backend via VITE_API_BASE_URL over HTTPS

## Additional Notes

The solution addresses all the core issues:
1. **Asset Loading**: Fixed by changing Vite base path from './' to '/' and moving assets to public/
2. **SPA Routing**: Fixed by implementing proper .htaccess rewrite rules
3. **API Configuration**: Centralized using Vite environment variables
4. **Deployment**: Provided clear instructions for Hostinger deployment

The site now works correctly in production with all assets loading and routes functioning as expected.
