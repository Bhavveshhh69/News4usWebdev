# Phase 2: PostgreSQL Integration Design

## 2.1 Enhanced Connection Management Design

### Current Issues
- SSL is disabled, creating a security vulnerability
- Connection pool settings are basic and not optimized for production
- No connection retry logic implemented

### Proposed Solutions
1. Enable SSL encryption for all database connections
2. Implement adaptive connection pooling based on load
3. Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Set up separate connection pools for different service priorities

## 2.2 Security Enhancement Design

### Current Issues
- SSL disabled
- Limited role-based access control
- No audit logging

### Proposed Solutions
1. Enable SSL with proper certificate management
2. Implement row-level security for sensitive data
3. Create detailed audit logging for all data modifications
4. Set up proper database user roles with minimal required permissions

## 2.3 Schema Optimization Design

### Current Issues
- Limited use of advanced PostgreSQL features
- Basic indexing strategy
- No partitioning for large tables

### Proposed Solutions
1. Implement materialized views for complex reporting queries
2. Add advanced indexing strategies (full-text search, partial indexes)
3. Design partitioning strategy for analytics tables
4. Utilize PostgreSQL's advanced data types more effectively

## 2.4 Performance Optimization Design

### Current Issues
- No query caching implemented
- Limited monitoring and alerting
- No automated performance tuning

### Proposed Solutions
1. Implement query result caching for frequently accessed data
2. Set up comprehensive database monitoring
3. Add automated performance tuning procedures
4. Implement read replicas for scaling read operations

## 2.5 Migration Strategy Design

### Current Issues
- Basic migration system
- No rollback procedures
- No pre/post migration validation

### Proposed Solutions
1. Implement versioned, idempotent migration scripts
2. Create rollback procedures for each migration
3. Add pre-migration validation checks
4. Implement post-migration verification steps

## 2.6 Detailed Design Specifications

### 2.6.1 Connection Pooling Enhancement
```
// New connection pool configuration
const pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: true,
    ca: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/server-ca.crt').toString(),
    key: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/client-key.crt').toString(),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/client-cert.crt').toString(),
  },
  max: process.env.DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS || 20,
  min: process.env.DB_MIN_CONNECTIONS || 5,
  idleTimeoutMillis: process.env.DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT || 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: process.env.DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT || 2000,
  acquireTimeoutMillis: process.env.DB_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT || 30000,
  retryAttempts: process.env.DB_RETRY_ATTEMPTS || 3,
  retryDelay: process.env.DB_RETRY_DELAY || 1000,
});
```

### 2.6.2 Enhanced Security Configuration
1. Database roles:
   - `app_user`: Read/write access to application tables
   - `read_only_user`: Read-only access for analytics
   - `admin_user`: Administrative access for schema changes
   - `audit_user`: Special role for audit logging

2. Row-level security policies for sensitive tables:
   - User data isolation
   - Organization-based data access (if multi-tenant)

3. Audit logging triggers:
   - Automatic logging of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
   - Capture user, timestamp, and changes made

### 2.6.3 Schema Optimization Plan

#### Materialized Views
```
-- Materialized view for article analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW article_analytics AS
SELECT 
  a.id as article_id,
  a.title,
  a.published_at,
  COUNT(av.id) as view_count,
  COUNT(c.id) as comment_count,
  COUNT(uf.id) as favorite_count
FROM articles a
LEFT JOIN article_views av ON a.id = av.article_id
LEFT JOIN comments c ON a.id = c.article_id
LEFT JOIN user_favorites uf ON a.id = uf.article_id
WHERE a.status = 'published'
GROUP BY a.id, a.title, a.published_at;

-- Refresh the materialized view periodically
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY article_analytics;
```

#### Partitioning Strategy
```
-- Partitioning for article_views table by month
CREATE TABLE article_views_partitioned (
  id SERIAL,
  article_id INTEGER,
  user_id INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE article_views_2025_10 PARTITION OF article_views_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-10-01') TO ('2025-11-01');

CREATE TABLE article_views_2025_11 PARTITION OF article_views_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-11-01') TO ('2025-12-01');
```

#### Advanced Indexing
```
-- Full-text search index for articles
ALTER TABLE articles ADD COLUMN searchable tsvector;
UPDATE articles SET searchable = 
  setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title, '')), 'A') ||
  setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(summary, '')), 'B') ||
  setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(content, '')), 'C');

CREATE INDEX idx_articles_searchable ON articles USING GIN (searchable);

-- Partial index for active users
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active ON users (email) WHERE is_active = true;

-- Covering index for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_author_status_covering 
ON articles (author_id, status) 
INCLUDE (id, title, published_at);
```

### 2.6.4 Performance Optimization Features

#### Query Result Caching
Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data:
- User session data
- Article metadata
- Category and tag information
- User preferences

#### Monitoring and Alerting
Set up monitoring for:
- Query performance metrics
- Connection pool utilization
- Disk space and I/O
- Lock contention

#### Automated Maintenance
- Regular ANALYZE and VACUUM operations
- Index rebuilds for fragmented indexes
- Statistics updates for query planner
