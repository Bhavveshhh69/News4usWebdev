- **Complex Query Performance**: 16ms
- **Insert Performance**: 9ms
- **Connection Pool Status**: 1 total, 1 idle, 0 waiting

## Verification Results

All tests have been successfully completed:

1. **Environment Validation**: ✅ PASSED
2. **Database Connection**: ✅ PASSED
3. **Database Operations**: ✅ PASSED
4. **Health Check**: ✅ PASSED
5. **Table Existence**: ✅ PASSED
6. **Phase 1 Integration**: ✅ PASSED

## Assessment Findings

### Current State
- PostgreSQL 18.0 database successfully configured
- All 14 required tables created with proper relationships
- Connection pooling properly implemented
- Comprehensive testing framework in place
- Security best practices followed

### Identified Opportunities
