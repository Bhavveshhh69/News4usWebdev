# Phase 5 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 5 focuses on implementing the comments system with ACID compliance. This phase adds the ability for users to comment on articles and engage in discussions.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Comments Repository
- **File**: `repositories/commentRepository.js`
- **Functions**:
  - `createComment`: Creates a new comment record with article comment count update
  - `getCommentById`: Retrieves a comment by ID with user information
  - `getCommentsByArticle`: Retrieves all comments for an article with pagination
  - `updateComment`: Updates a comment with authorization check
  - `deleteComment`: Soft deletes a comment with article comment count update
  - `getReplies`: Retrieves replies to a comment with pagination

### 2. Comments Service
- **File**: `services/commentService.js`
- **Functions**:
  - `createNewComment`: Creates a new comment with validation
  - `getComment`: Retrieves a comment by ID
  - `getArticleComments`: Retrieves all comments for an article with pagination
  - `updateExistingComment`: Updates an existing comment
  - `deleteExistingComment`: Soft deletes an existing comment
  - `getCommentReplies`: Retrieves replies to a comment

### 3. Comments Controller
- **File**: `controllers/commentController.js`
- **Functions**:
  - `createCommentHandler`: Handles POST requests to create comments
  - `getCommentHandler`: Handles GET requests to retrieve a comment
  - `getArticleCommentsHandler`: Handles GET requests to retrieve article comments
  - `updateCommentHandler`: Handles PUT requests to update a comment
  - `deleteCommentHandler`: Handles DELETE requests to delete a comment
  - `getRepliesHandler`: Handles GET requests to retrieve comment replies

### 4. Comments Routes
- **File**: `routes/commentRoutes.js`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/comments`: Create a new comment
  - `GET /api/comments/:id`: Get comment by ID
  - `GET /api/comments/article/:articleId`: Get comments for an article
  - `PUT /api/comments/:id`: Update a comment
  - `DELETE /api/comments/:id`: Delete a comment
  - `GET /api/comments/:commentId/replies`: Get replies to a comment

### 5. Database Migration
- **File**: `migrations/005-create-comments-table.js`
- Creates the comments table with proper relationships and indexes
- Adds comment_count column to articles table

### 6. Updated Server Configuration
- **File**: `server.js`
- Integrated comments routes into the Express application
- **File**: `migrations/run-migration.js`
- Added comments migration to the migration runner

## ACID Compliance Features

### Atomicity
- All database operations use transactions where appropriate
- Multi-step operations (comment creation with article count update) are wrapped in transactions to ensure all-or-nothing execution

### Consistency
- Database constraints ensure data integrity
- Validation at multiple levels (input, business logic, database)
- Foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity

### Isolation
- Proper transaction isolation levels
- Concurrent access handling through database mechanisms

### Durability
- Database-level persistence ensures committed transactions are permanent
- Proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

## Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication for protected endpoints
- Token validation middleware

### Authorization
- User-based access control (users can only modify their own comments)
- Proper authorization checks

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input validation for all endpoints
- Sanitization of user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Content length validation

### Rate Limiting
- Rate limiting middleware for API endpoints (inherited from existing middleware)

## Testing

### Test Files
- **File**: `test-comments-service.js` - Tests comments service functionality

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully, demonstrating that:
- Comment creation works correctly
- Comment retrieval works correctly
- Article comments retrieval works correctly
- Comment update works correctly
- Comment deletion works correctly
- Comment replies functionality works correctly
- ACID compliance is maintained throughout all operations

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Repository Pattern**: All data access is handled through repositories for better separation of concerns
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic is encapsulated in services
3. **Controller Layer**: HTTP request handling is separated from business logic
4. **Middleware**: Reusable validation and authentication logic
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
6. **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
7. **Nested Comments**: Support for replies to comments
8. **Soft Delete**: Comments are soft deleted to maintain data integrity
9. **Article Count Tracking**: Articles maintain a count of their comments

## API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Authentication | Authorization |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| POST | /api/comments | Create comment | Required | Authenticated User |
| GET | /api/comments/:id | Get comment by ID | Optional | None |
| GET | /api/comments/article/:articleId | Get article comments | Optional | None |
| PUT | /api/comments/:id | Update comment | Required | Owner |
| DELETE | /api/comments/:id | Delete comment | Required | Owner |
| GET | /api/comments/:commentId/replies | Get comment replies | Optional | None |

## Data Model

The comments table contains the following fields:
- `id`: Primary key
- `content`: Comment text content
- `author_id`: Foreign key to users table
- `article_id`: Foreign key to articles table
- `parent_id`: Foreign key to comments table (for replies)
- `is_deleted`: Soft delete flag
- `created_at`: Timestamp of creation
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update

The articles table was also updated to include:
- `comment_count`: Count of comments for the article

This completes Phase 5 implementation with full ACID compliance and security features.
